> Let me ask you: was this a difficult compute inteive question for you or not? (look at another file and follow logic) 
Do you work better with one file only? I noticed that when I asked you to modify the quarto website file organization you struggled a lot 

⏺ This is a great question about how I work! Let me break down the difference:

  What worked well here (current task):

  Pattern matching + structured data
  - Clear reference file (disability/index.qmd) with repetitive structure
  - Explicit list of plots (visualizations.R lines 644-807) with clear naming
  - Simple mapping: "copy this pattern, swap the plot names"
  - Minimal decision-making needed - mostly mechanical substitution

  This is like following a recipe: "do X, then Y, then Z with these 20 ingredients"

  What was harder (website reorganization task):

  Complex decision-making with dependencies
  - Multiple interconnected files (_quarto.yml, sidebar structure, file paths)
  - Ambiguous requirements ("reorganize" - many valid approaches)
  - Cascading effects (moving one thing breaks links elsewhere)
  - Need to understand intent not just structure
  - Risk of breaking existing functionality

  This is like reorganizing a kitchen while people are cooking - need to understand workflows, dependencies, and avoid breaking
  things.

  How I work best:

  1. Clear examples to follow ✅ (like this task)
  2. Explicit lists/specifications ✅ (20 plots with names)
  3. Single-purpose edits ✅ (build one file)
  4. Pattern repetition ✅ (same structure × 20)

  What's harder:

  1. Ambiguous goals ❌ (restructure "better")
  2. Cross-file dependencies ❌ (sidebar + files + links)
  3. Judgment calls ❌ (what's the "right" organization?)
  4. Reversing previous decisions ❌ (undo/redo cycles)

  For future tasks:

  If you need complex restructuring, consider:
  - Breaking it into smaller, sequential steps
  - Providing explicit specifications ("move X to Y, rename Z to W")
  - Accepting that I may need clarifying questions
  - Being patient with iterations

  For pattern-following tasks (like this one):
  - Just point me to the reference + the data - I'll handle it well!
